# BloodyTelevision - Answers to question

For this project you will need to run: 

pip install requests

When the program is run, the charts will be show one at a time, to get the next chart just close the current chart.
Each question has its own chart except question 5 which uses two.


question 1:
Has the crime decreased or increased over the last 20 years?

Decreased as seen by the first diagram that is shown.

Has the type of crime changed?
We would expect that 2 of the graphs to be crossing if there was a tendency for crime to have changed, 
which cannot be seen, so crime has not changed.

Has the crime moved to from one area to another?
The chart shows the top 3 states with most crime from 2010 and 2013. we would expect to see that the top 3 would change during the 3 years, but it doesnt.
So the conclusion is that the crime hasnt moved from the top 3 states at least.

Is there a connection between type of crimes and locations?
The more people, the more crime. California and Texas has nicer cars.

Which year was the most crime and what crime occured most times?
as seen from the chart from question 1, we can see that 1994 had the most crime, and from that larceny has the most incidents.
